# phone-recording-email-script

This script is in production to send recordings from the duty supervisor phone line to the #dutysups channel on our Slack workspace. It was taken from [dslauter](https://community.freepbx.org/u/dslauter)'s [very helpful comment](https://community.freepbx.org/t/solved-how-to-email-call-recordings-post-call-recording-script/26747/6) on the FreePBX forums and modified to fit our needs.
